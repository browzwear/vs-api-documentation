## Defining a garment as a smart template
In order to start working on a smart template, you first need to configure the garment as a smart template garment. In the UI this is done via the `Configure` button. In the API, you use the `SmartTemplateGarmentSet` function.

```python
garmentId = BwApi.GarmentId()

# set the garment as smart template garment if necessary
if not BwApi.SmartTemplateGarmentGet(garmentId):
  BwApi.SmartTemplateGarmentSet(garmentId)
```
