Browzwear's plugin mechanism allows you to extend or change the behavior of Browzwear’s applications.  

Plugins can be written in C, C++, Python, and C#.

The Browzwear plugin architecture is very powerful. Plugins have access to garment, shapes, clusters, stitches, materials, and so on.  You can create plugins that import your own model’s format or export garments to your format.
